This is a test I did for saving patient information. It is done using php and mysql.
it is expected to capture user data that is;
  1. Patient Details
  2. Patient's next of kin info.
  3. it should save to database once verified by internal mechanisms
  4. Finaly it should send an email to the said Patient with a conguratory note.
The system is not perfect and needs to be improved. Feel free to try out.
If smtp(mail server) is not configured, the error below although having saved patient's data will be thrown.
